Overview
This project explores Home Loan EMI calculations, amortization schedules, and scenario analysis using Python. It combines mathematical reasoning with practical tools for financial decision-making.

Features
- EMI Calculation
- Formula-based computation of monthly installments.
- Amortization Tables
- Month-on-month breakdown of principal vs interest.
- Year-on-year summaries for clarity.
- Prepayment Scenarios
- Lump sum prepayment impact on loan tenure.
- Extra prepayment impact on loan tenure.

Modules:
1. Open "config.py" -> Change parameters as per your requirement. Avoid those parameters which are not relevant for your usecase.
2. Run tree_decide.py -> you'll get 4 options -> choose based on your scenario
3. Vanilla Calculator.py -> Perform Standard Amortization
4. Lumpsum_Calculator.py -> Perform scenario where you are paying lumpsum
5. Regular_Interval_Calculator.py -> Perform scenario where you are paying extra on momnthly, quaterly or yearly basis.
6. Hybrid_calculator.py -> Perform combination of all the above scenarios discussed above.
